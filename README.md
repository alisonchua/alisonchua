Hi, I'm Alison and I am interested in programming and I want to learn to code.
I like the idea of creation, automation and efficiency through coding. 
I like using data to see trends and in decision-making. I am currently going through the CS50 course and would like to take up the Business Analyst course next.
I am not great at communicating my thoughts clearly but I hope one day, I'll be a brilliant story-teller. 

Fun fact about me is that I love digital drawing and someday, I'd like to see my art in homes across the world.
